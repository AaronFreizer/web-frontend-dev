                <p>The negotiator should work out his best alternative to a negotiated agreement before the start
                    of any negotiation. This will help negotiators prepare for better outcomes with most preferred
                    outcome
                    being win-win outcome. A win-win situation is an approach where both parties win which is the
                    ideal
                    outcome for almost all negotiations. According to Forsyth (2009), the negotiating process
                    involves
                    balancing matters between two parties so that the negotiator not only gets what he wants but
                    also
                    gets
                    what he wants in the best possible way</p>
                <blockquote>By doing proper preparation and planning before negotiations, negotiators increase
                    their
                    value. Planning
                    is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now. Negotiation
                    becomes a
                    process undertaken in everyday activities to manage relationships. According to Ghauri and
                    Usunier,
                    (2003) in some personal negotiation, stakes are not that high and there is no need to pre-plan
                    process
                    and the outcome </blockquote>
