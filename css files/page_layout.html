            <h3>Looking for a unique gift?</h3>
            <p>Town Hall has the answer. For only 100 you can get a book of tickets for all of the remaining speakers.
                And
                the bargain includes a second book of tickets for companion.</p>
            <p class="indent">Or, for 50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers, and still get an extra ticket
                for
                companion, but for just one of the events.</p>
            <p class="indent">See you at the next show</p>
            <p><em>Contact us by phone</em> at (559) 555-1212 for ticket information.</p>

            <h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
            <h4> Event Change for November</h4>
            <p>One of the opportunities has been the rise of mobile and VoIP applications. As the use of video- and
                audio-conferencing tools increases significantly, organizations have ramped up their technology
                infrastructure to account for the surge. Siau (2020) notes the covid 19 pandemic has not only made
                businesses realise the importance of utilising technologies to build resilience</p>
            <h4>Lecture Day,time and location</h4>
            <p>. This will lead to increased investment in bandwidth expansion, network equipment, and software that
                leverages cloud services. With employees becoming acclimatized to the idea of work-from-home (WFH),
                meeting and transacting online, firms will shift to WFH as a norm rather than as an exception</p>
