            <p>By doing proper preparation and planning before negotiations, negotiators increase their value. Planning
                is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now. Negotiation becomes a
                process undertaken in everyday activities to manage relationships. According to Ghauri and Usunier,
                (2003) in some personal negotiation, stakes are not that high and there is no need to pre-plan process
                and the outcome but in cases like business relationships, the stakes are high and there is need to
                prepare, plan and negotiate more carefully.d</p>
