            <p id="men">Negotiation in business is constantly changing. There is no one best way, no one best plan, no
                single uncluttered system that best produces understanding about negotiation. There are many factors
                that influence the negotiation process. The most typical factors that affect how a negotiation will play
                out are time, environment, personalities, information, personal issues and hierarchy plus time factor.
            </p>
            <p id="woman">The negotiator should work out his best alternative to a negotiated agreement before the start
                of any negotiation. This will help negotiators prepare for better outcomes with most preferred outcome
                being win-win outcome. A win-win situation is an approach where both parties win which is the ideal
                outcome for almost all negotiations. According to Forsyth (2009), the negotiating process involves
                balancing matters between two parties so that the negotiator not only gets what he wants but also gets
                what he wants in the best possible way</p>
            <p id="me">By doing proper preparation and planning before negotiations, negotiators increase their value. Planning
                is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now. Negotiation becomes a
                process undertaken in everyday activities to manage relationships. According to Ghauri and Usunier,
                (2003) in some personal negotiation, stakes are not that high and there is no need to pre-plan process
                and the outcome but in cases like business relationships, the stakes are high and there is need to
                prepare, plan and negotiate more carefully . The negotiators need to decide what it is they want to
                achieve and why the other party should negotiate with them. This is further supported by Etherington
                (2008), negotiators should also think why they should negotiate with the other party. Organizations need
                to understand that they must spend time planning.</p>
            <p>When negotiators show commitment to the negotiation process, that also improves value of the negotiation.
                There must be a serious commitment to achieving the result a negotiator wants. Oliver (2010) states that
                if you are serious then you will be taken seriously; if you are casual then you will be taken casually.
